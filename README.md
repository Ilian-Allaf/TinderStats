# <p align="center">TinderStats Chrome Extension</p>

TinderStats is a Chrome extension that keeps track of your Tinder activities such as swipes, likes, passes, sent messages, and received messages. It provides you with a simple and user-friendly interface to view your Tinder statistics.

## How it Works

The TinderStats Chrome extension works by intercepting the network requests made by the Tinder website while you're using it. It counts the number of likes, passes, sent messages, and received messages and stores them in the local storage of your browser. It then updates the values displayed on the popup window in real-time using the stored values.
